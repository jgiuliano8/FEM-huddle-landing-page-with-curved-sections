## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS3
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- SVGs

### What I learned

Working with SVGs and making them responsive was
a learning process. It took me some time to scour
the web and finally tweak a solution. I pulled the
'height' and 'width' attributes out of the SVGs
to make them responsive. Then I put them in
adjacent divs to make sections look like they had
curved borders. But I was getting a bad effect
where there would be a line, sometimes, between
the SVG and the adjacent section. So I finally
came across a solution that I tweaked to fit my
project:

```css
.pixel-fix {
  transform: scale(1, 1.05);
  overflow: visible;
}
```

I scaled the SVGs in the Y direction only and then
made the overflow visible. (Initially I scaled
the entire SVG at 1.05 but that caused
side-scrolling. So I scaled the X direction at a
1 which of course does not change anything in the
X direction.)

### Continued development

I probably need to understand and use SVGs more
deeply. Maybe more projects with SVGs.
